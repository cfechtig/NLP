Juan Almonte resigned his diplomatic post in indignation over this event. Isaac Van Zandt began discussing this plan with Abel Upshur before Upshur died. Anson Jones proposed this plan, which reduced his own power but reserved the weaker side the right to split into five parts in the future. Five years after it, a payment of 10 million dollars helped the area at issue repay debts. The Regulator-Moderator war was calmed just before this deal was struck. The question of whether the Nueces River became a southern border in this transaction led to war later in James K. Polk's presidency.
