This condition can be caused by deficiencies of triosephosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The presence of Heinz bodies accompanies several potential causes of this condition. Although it's not gastritis, autoimmune destruction of parietal cells causes one type of this condition, and another type of this condition is characterized by the production of spherocytes. Some forms of this condition are treated with ESAs, or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Some causes of this condition confer resistance to malaria, and it is commonly caused by iron deficiency.
